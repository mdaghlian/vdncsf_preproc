# Follow jurjen fmriproc 
https://github.com/mdaghlian/fmriproc

[1] New conda environment

conda create --prefix=~/.conda/envs/fmriproc_00X python=3.11

# then to activate it run: 

conda activate fmriproc_00X 

[2] Pip install 

pip install git+https://github.com/mdaghlian/fmriproc

[3] Set up the config file 
- see the spinoza_config file in this repo

- When you have made sure all your paths are correct we can install with 

# MAKE SURE THAT correct conda environment is active 

check with `which python` should point to the correct place

spinoza_install setup /path/to/spinoza_config

# Check .bash_profile 
- make sure paths are correct



[4] Setting up SPM and CAT 12 
- Tricky apparently
- need to have access to an spm folder with cat12 in it
- export SPM_PATH="/packages/matlab/toolbox/spm12" seems to do the trick (inside spinoza config)






# fmriproc editing
* Jurjen has made a fantasitc pipeline for running preprocessing
* but sometimes it needs to be edited
* the way to do this properly is: 

[1] git fork your own fmriproc
[2] pip install git+<your_fork>
[3] If something goes wrong: trouble shoot and edit the pip installed files
- code $(which call_blah)
- make edits, test, repeat
[4] When you have found the fix
- copy the change from [3] into your local fork 
- stage, commit and push the changes to the github
- then reinstall it to your environment 
- the flags mean you don't have to do everything again...
pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/mdaghlian/fmriproc

Is it a problem in general? Then consider putting in a pull request
