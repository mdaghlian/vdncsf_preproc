# Follow jurjen fmriproc 
https://github.com/mdaghlian/fmriproc

[1] New conda environment

conda create --prefix=~/.conda/envs/fmriproc_00X python=3.11

[2] Pip install 

pip install git+https://github.com/mdaghlian/fmriproc

[3] Set up the config file 
- change directories for projects etc
- make sure ACQ=MP2RAGE is selected
- SPM_PATH=/home/daghlian/software/spm


[4] Setting up SPM and CAT 12 
- Tricky apparently
- need to have access to an spm folder with cat12 in it
- export SPM_PATH="/packages/matlab/toolbox/spm12" seems to do the trick (inside spinoza config)

Test till it works
