# ****************************** RUNNING PREPROC 
# [*] Ensure naming is correct: copying from rawdata->sourcedata
sub-***_ses-LE_task-CSF_run-
Replace any CSFLE -> CSF (& pRFLE etc)
Also need to do rename inside .PAR files 
Do this with the following (replacing as necessary)
find . -type f -name "*.PAR" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/pRFLE/pRF/g'

Also do renaming for anatomical files into a separate session
ses-A (for anatomy)

# [*] master -m 02a: BIDSify with fmriproc
master -m 02a -s amb01 -n LE 

# [*] EXTRA: For ses-A need to do something special
to fix the renaming / phase separation issue
master02a_MP2rage_fix.sh -s amb01 -n A

# [*] master -m 02b MRIqc: quality control for bold with mriqc 
master -m 02b -s gla03 -n LE --func-only

Inspect the outputs


# [*] master -m 04:  pymp2rage 
creating T1w/T1map images from the first and second inversion images using Pymp2rage.
master -m 04 -s amb01 -n A


# [*] EXTRA STEP: rigid body registration for T2w 
- extra step from, not in jurjens pipeline
- need the T2w to be in same space as T1w, so coregistering it to the T1w in pymp2rage

T2w_register.sh -s amb01 -n A 

# [*] master -m 05b: ANT registration
for MNI image; which helps with making a really good mask

master -m 05b -s amb01 -n A 

# [*] master -m 07: Sinus mask from MNI 

Notes - originally the idea was to use the T1w/T2w ratio

JH - now recommends using T2w only... But 

master -m 07 -s amb01 -n A

NOTE - may have to redo this properly with itk snap and editing later...  [--itk]
Also - had to fix the mni naming stuff 

# [*] master -m 08: bias correction
is applied to remove intensity inhomogeneities

master -m 08 -s amb01 -n A

# [*] master -m 09 Skull extraction

master -m 09 -s amb01 -n A

# [?] master -m 10: Nordic? -- skipping for now.... 


# [*] master -m 11: dura, mask out the dura using nighres 
NEED NIGHRES -> did this in .bash_profile 
# FOR NIGHRES
# FOR NIGHRES

# [*] master -m 12: sagittal Sinus
