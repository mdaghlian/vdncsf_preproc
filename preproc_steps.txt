# ****************************** RUNNING PREPROC 
[*] Ensure naming is correct: copying from rawdata->sourcedata
sub-***_ses-LE_task-CSF_run-
Replace any CSFLE -> CSF (& pRFLE etc)
Also need to do rename inside .PAR files 
Do this with the following (replacing as necessary)
find . -type f -name "*.PAR" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/ses-LE/ses-A/g'

Also do renaming for anatomical files into a separate session
ses-A (for anatomy)

[*] BIDSify with fmriproc: e.g.,
master -m 02a -s amb01 -n LE 

[*] For ses-A need to do something special- to fix the renaming / phase separation issue
master02a_MP2rage_fix.sh -s amb01 -n A

[*] MRIqc: quality control for bold with mriqc 
master -m 02b -s amb01 -n LE --func-only

Inspect the outputs

[*] pymp2rage 
creating T1w/T1map images from the first and second inversion images using Pymp2rage.
master -m 04 -s amb01 -n A

[*] ANT registration - for MNI image; which helps with making a really good mask
master -m 05b -s amb01 -n A 

[*] Bias correction is applied to remove intensity inhomogeneities. To apply bias correction and denoising:

master -m 08 -s amb01 -n A
